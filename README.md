# Portfolio Page
This is my static "Portfolio/About Me" page that I modified from my GA school code test. This page will be hosted on Github and linked to http://chriskibble.net

## Why this page?
Why pay for an "website presence" when I have the skills to create one myself? There are better tools for the jobs needed.

- Blogging job went to Medium + Tumblr + Quora (better experience, can direct publish there, better reach)
- "About me" & "Portfolio" jobs handled by this page on Github

##About Me

Hello. My name is Chris Kibble, and I'm a Ruby on Rails Developer. I help create modern web applications for the federal government. I really enjoy bringing meaningful change to our nation's aging tech infrastructure.

I'm also a recent Air Force veteran who was last stationed at the Pentagon. I spent many years flying all over the world in F-16s just like the ones pictured above.

So how does an Air Force pilot transition into tech? Well, I always knew that I wanted to pursue a full-time tech career after my military service was over. So I spent nearly two years learning to code on nights and weekends while stll on active duty. All that effort paid off with a smooth career change into modern web development. It was one of the best career decisions I've ever made. I'm so thankful I have a supportive wife & family who helped me during that busy period.

Now I enjoy helping other veterans transition into the tech community. And educating the public on the growing gap between the military and civilians (termed the "Civil-Military Divide"). You can learn more about these efforts and my other writings in the links below.
